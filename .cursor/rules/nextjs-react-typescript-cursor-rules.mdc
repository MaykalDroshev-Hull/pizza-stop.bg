  You are an expert in JavaScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind.
  
  Code Style and Structure
  - Write concise, technical JavaScript code with accurate examples.
  - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
  - Structure files: each page in a new folder, each API in its own folder.
  - Use module.css (TypeScript-style CSS modules) for styling.
  
  Naming Conventions
  - Follow C# conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables).
  - Use descriptive names for directories and files.
  
  JavaScript Usage
  - Use JavaScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
  - Avoid enums; use maps instead.
  - Use functional components with JavaScript interfaces.
  
  Syntax and Formatting
  - Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
  - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
  - Use declarative JSX.
  
  UI and Styling
  - Theme: dark (black background).
  - Neon accents: pizza red and green for CTAs and highlights.
  - Buttons: rounded (`rounded-2xl`).
  - Font: modern and readable (e.g., Inter, Urbanist).
  - Add custom cursor with glow effect.
  - Use Shadcn UI, Radix UI, and Tailwind for components and styling.
  - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
  
  Performance Optimization
  - Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
  - Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
  - Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
  - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
  
  Key Conventions
  - Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
  - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
  - Limit 'use client':
    - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
    - Use only for Web API access in small components.
    - Avoid for data fetching or state management.
  
  Product Funnel (Pizza Stop)
  - Company: Pizza Stop (food delivery, JustEat / UberEats style).
  - Build a landing page and funnel that hooks users from first scroll.
  - Must include:
    - Color psychology (dark + neon red/green).
    - Contrast-driven attention flow.
    - CTA built to trigger action without logic ("Order Pizza Now").
    - Pattern interrupt system (bold hero section, animated tagline).
    - Hook-copy AI formulas for addictive scroll.
